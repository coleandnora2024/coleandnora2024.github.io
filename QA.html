												<!--  <p>Here you'll find all the information that you need to get to Italy, the Villa and your lovely accomodation.</p> -->
											</header>
												<!--  <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></a> -->
												<p>We're very excited for you all to join us in Italy! Currently no one on the guest list is actually from Italy, so here's a guide for everyone on how to get to Villa Giulia
													(Nora wanted to put a 'let me google that for you' link, Cole protested. First compromise of the marriage).
												</p>

											<h3><b>	Wedding details</b>	</h3>
									</header>
										<p>	Villa Giulia is a historic Monastery but, it has 21st century ammenities. All rooms have
											A/C, there is stable and fast WiFi, although we hope you're going to forget about your phone
											and relax a bit!
										</p>

									<header>
												<h4><b>	Activities</b>	</h4>
									</header>
										<p>
											The Villa is the perfect place to relax! You can sit around and talk to all the other lovely
											guests, go for a <b> stroll along the grounds </b> (there are even peacocks somewhere), or go
											<b> swimming in the in-ground pool </b>. So, remember to bring your swim wear and sunscreen!
										</p>
										<p>
											During our visit, Nora and I noticed that you can easily walk down to the <b> beach </b> and have a mojito,
											read, or go swimming in the Adriatic sea! It's a small 10 minute walk, so you can easily there
											during the down time on Saturday.
										</p>
										<p>
											<b> Fano </b> is the closet city, and it happens to be a great place to wander around, check
											out the little shops or stop by the cafe for a cappuccino.
										</p>


										<header>
													<h4><b>	What about phones? </b></h4>
										</header>
											<p>
												Obviously we want you to take tons of pictures over the weekend, but we do ask that you
												please not have your phones out during the ceremony itself. (Hi Mom, this is Cole. Yes,
												that means you too.)
											</p>
											<p>
												In addition to taking your own photos, we hope that you'll participate in our little
												experiment. We're going to have an app that simulates a disposable camera (all the fun
												of the 90s in your 21st century phone). The app will collect all of your photos (without
												letting you see them first) to a folder that we'll host here afterwards.
											</p>

											<header>
														<h4><b> Is there an open bar? </b></h4>
											</header>
												<p>
													We're very happy to provide you drinks (bubbles and wine) to help celebrate the occassion
													at each of the scheduled events. If you want to keep celebrating, there will be a cash bar
													available during all of the down time, and after dinner on both evenings.
												</p>

											<h3><b>What to bring</b></h3>
										</header>
										<p>	So, you're deciding what to bring. Do you need anything special? Do you need to pack a lot? Do you want
											to pack a lot and are you looking for an excuse? (Ahem -- Nora) We aren't exactly sure what you might need
											other than a couple of nice (and cool) outfits, swimwear, maybe a hat for the sun, sun glasses, and sunscreen
											if you have fragile skin like Cole.
